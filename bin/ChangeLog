	* dcvdpv.r: modified to changed "Inf" values to "NA" values so those will be removed during plotting.

2018-10-16-13:39  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* dcvdpv.r: Quickly hacked script to generate dCV/dPV ratios for entry-based exposure and hsolute. It should be refactored to be more like the other scripts as time permits.
	* reduce-exps.sh (EXPs): Use the new dcvdpv.r script on each experiment directory.

2018-10-12  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

2018-10-07  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* Hcounts-avgsd.r: changed format of the output data row names because of an error for experiments with 1 MC trial.

2018-10-01  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* dataperH-inband.r: deleted if block that checks if "There is only 1 Monte Carlo trial present." and then quits.
	* Hsums-Dist-MC.r: fixed error in "colnames" function if used on data for one MC trial.

2018-09-21-09:37  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (CLASSPATH): Upgrade to MASON 19, compiled with Java 10. Note that I had to change the MASON javac args from "-target 1.5 -source 1.5" to "-target 1.6 -source 1.6".

2018-09-20  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* inextra-inband.r, dataperH-inband.r: added a check if the minimum distance used for the band is greater than the maximum distance of the data. If true, then the distance direction, either dCV or dPV, is skipped. This was easier for inextra-band.r than dataperH-inband.r because of the loop of MC trials. Therefore, it may be better to rewrite dataperH-inband.r for efficiency and readability (maybe like body-avg.r?).	

2018-09-19  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* compare-exps.sh: added plotting (using cmp-by-col.r) of exposure files generated during experimental reduction. The plot files are in the "g-exposure" directory.

2018-09-18  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* dataperH-inband.r: modified to only calculate the average and standard deviation of data per vHPC, i.e <data/vHPC>i (i over MC trials), which is used for exposure.
	* reduce-exps.sh: Hsum-Dist-MC.r added so the output files of the vHPC sums over distance bands and MC trials are included in the reduced directory.

2018-09-12  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* Hsum-Dist-MC.r: new script that calculates the sum of Hepatocytes for each dPV and dCV distance bands over all MC trials.

2018-09-11  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* calc-exposure.r: new script that is just the reduction part of plot-exposure.r in the Github repository (i.e. without the plotting)
	* reduce-exps.sh: calc-exposure.r has been added to output the exposure files to the reduced directory (i.e. exp-reduced) during standard reduction of raw output files from an experiment.

2018-09-11  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* rename-link-exps.sh: new script that combines rename-exps.sh and link-exps.sh so that the resulting link can be used for compare-exps.sh. This does not replace either rename-exps.sh or link-exps.sh as those can still be used separately; however, this is specifically supposed to be used for compare-exps.sh downstream.

2018-09-07-17:05  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

2018-07-19  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* dataperH-inband.r: renamed MeasureHPC-inband.r to this script.
	* utility shell scripts: replaced "experiments" with "exps", renamed "analyze-experiments.sh" to "reduce-exps.sh", and within these files replaced "analysis" with "reduced" to maintain a consistent workflow (no broken dirnames).

	* cmp-by-col.r: Add the ability to plot all the columns in the 1st experiment listed, even if that column does not exist in the remaining files.

2018-06-05  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* MeasureHPC-inband.r: script similar to inextra-inband.r but ouputs many different statistics on different Solutes within Hepatocytes, such as Solute(all MC trials)/MC trial and Solute(all MC trials)/HPC(all MC trials) for both a distance band and whole lobule, and avg and stddev (Solute/HPC) for each time across all MC trials. Also, The HPC counts for whole lobule and within distance band are outputted for each trial and each distance.

	* nec[trig|rotic]-inband.r: Delete.
	* reduce-event-data-inband.r: Replaces nec[trig|rotic]-inband.r.  Will also work for "stressed" after ^/branches/islj-hepn is reintegrated.

2018-05-21-14:23  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* analyze-experiments.sh, nectrig.r, necrotic.r, reduce-event-data.r: Replace nectrig.r and necrotic.r with reduce-event-data.r, since they are processed the same. reduce-event-data.r also works with the "stressed" state available only in ^/branches/islj-hepn so far.

2018-04-22  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* link-experiments.sh, cmp-by-col.r: Reformatted the code, added clearer usage.

2018-03-15-11:56  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* cmp-by-col.r: Fix bug that caused script to fail with NA values in a column. The na.rm=T parameter was given to the outer call to max(), but was supposed to be given to the inner call to max().

2018-03-02-10:39  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* necr[trig|otic]-inband.r: Add test for the existence of any nectrig or necrotic events for the specified band.  If not, say so in the output. Also Δ Time_of_Necrosis → Time.  And correct the interval from [dMin,dMax] to [dMin,dMax).

2018-01-03-15:23  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* inextra-inband.r: New script to reduce both hsol- and xcls- data.
	* analyze-experiments.sh: Add header, timestamp, and script source trickery so you can execute from elsewhere.  Changed hsol-inband.r to inextra-inband.r, which reduces both the intraH (hsol) and the new xcls (eXtraCellular Location Specific) data.

2018-01-02  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* necrotic-inband.r: new script to subset necrotic data based on a range of distances for both dCV and dPV. This script is similar to hsol-inband.r
	* nectrig-inband.r: new script to subset necrotic data based on a range of distances for both dCV and dPV. This script is similar to hsol-inband.r

2017-12-07-09:20  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* cmp-by-col.r: Change the way the data frames are accessed so that it's easier to slice out a 0:max.1 range of cycles.

2017-11-16  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* compare-experiments.sh: added loop for "enzyme" files
	* rename-experiment.sh: deleted
	* rename-experiments.sh: renames multiple experiments

	* cmp-by-col.r: SEMILOG default FALSE → TRUE.
	* fextract.r: Increase the PREWINDOW from 3 to 31.  It turns out even in the Body case, the negative bias from the discretization of the input versus the inherent smoothness of the output shows up in the long-term.

2017-10-23-15:19  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* fextract.r (extRatio): Add a 3-point moving average to each MC trial raw[In|Out]put-????.csv in order to compensate for the pRandomized component execution order.

	* fextract.r: Rewrite to make the calculations from raw[In|Out]put-????.csv from the simulation, which no longer produces the derived outFract, extRatio, or doseFract.  Note that we're not generating doseFract with this script because it needs the maxSolute amounts for each Solute type, which is output in the log file.  So, it will be easy to do by hand if needed.

2017-10-09-16:24  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* cmp-by-col.r: Add a semilog option as a constant in the script.

	* jsoncalc.r: added the line "require(jsonlite)"

2017-08-08-16:20  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* jsoncalc.r: New script to calculate and print summary stats on hepinit-????.json files, both per trial and over all trials per experiment.  Note that the hepinit-????.json output reflect the (potentially false) instance variables inside the Hepatocyte objects.

2017-06-15-15:26  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* eg-dPV.r, hsol-inband.r: Pull averaging function out of eg-dPV.r and put it in misc.r.  Call that new function (avgByColumn()) in a new script for hsol-inband.r, which uses the new hsolute-d[PC]V-????.csv.gz output files.

2017-07-06-09:00  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* eg-dPV.r: Remove trailing slash from directory names.  Fixes a bug where if someone executes with eg-dPV.r directory/, it creates a file inside that directory starting with the '_' character.

2017-05-24  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

2017-05-02-16:29  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* linkprep.sh (TGT_DIR): Add 2 tests to see if build/classes exists and if ../exp/* exists.
	* everything: Replace rxnProduct with hsolute in all scripts because the old "rxnProduct" wasn't an accurate description of what the files contained.  There's now a new output file with "rxnprod" indicating the reaction product count.

2016-03-30  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (bsg-r834.jar): Use new BSG library (MyInt → MutableInt).

2016-03-09  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (CLASSPATH): Include (temporary) relative path to the new bsg.util jar file.
	(CLASSPATH): Change library dependency from another netbeans project to the bsg.jar file, checked out via the svn:externals property, which automatically checks out https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/bsg-ucsf/trunks/bsg/dist/bsg.jar, revision 826 and places it in islj/lib/bsg-r826.jar.  To see the svn:externals property, check out islj and issue the command "$ svn propget svn:externals islj/lib".

2015-11-25  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* body-avg.r: changed to use 1 or more experiment directories

2015-04-09  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com> 

	* compare-all.sh: modified to use changed filenames

	* analog-sampling.sh: bash script to sample MC trials from a set of analog experiments creating a new analog.  This sampling is done according to the following logic:
1) user inputs number of MC trials, nMC, and a file containing experiment dirs
2) randomly select one experiment dir 
3) from that exp dir, randomly select one MC trial, which contains
   6 files (i.e. body, dead, enzymes, run, rxnProduct_zone_1_2, and 
   rxnProduct_zone_3) 
4) repeat nMC times
5) put all sampled files into an output directory

2015-04-01  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* compare-dead.r: Make axis labels readable by increasing their font size.

	* cmp-by-col.r: Restrict plot comparisons to the columns available in the first file argument and to those columns that exist in all file arguments.

2015-02-27  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* linkprep.sh (javascripts): In order to accommodate allowing experiment-specific JavaScript dose scripts, Ι changed this script so that it uses the *.js files in the experiment directory as the index, and removes those in the classpath, if they exist.  If a script in the experiment directory does not exist in the current build/classes directory, an ignorable error is issued.  It then creates symbolic links to all those *.js files in build/classes/isl/model/.

2015-02-24  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* cmp-by-col.r: more convenient comparison plot script.  E.g. cmp-by-col.r exp00?x_dead.csv

2015-02-09  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (CLASSPATH): Upgrade to MASON 18.

2015-02-02  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (NANO): Use the "-" flag on the date format so the nanoseconds aren't padded with zeros.

	* compare-rxn.r: Renamed from "met" for metabolite to "rxn" for reaction product.

	* run.sh: Changed output directory to add nanoseconds /100k to make the name more unique.  This helps prevent duplicate directory names when scripting the execution of many experiments that might start at the same time.

	* compare-ofer.r: Added a script to compare the output of islj-dr.r, analogous with compare-rxn.r and compare-body.r.

2015-01-29  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* rxn.r: Change to accommodate new reaction product output filenames.

2014-12-26  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* dead.r: Added an accumulating statdeadfilename so that all expDirs used are included in the data.frame.  Changed row.names to reflect 1 variable per expDir row.  Changed data.frame so that it contains all the variables for a single expDir in one column (rather than 2 cols).  Removed code to re-define the row.names for each expDir.  "cbind" each expDir onto the data.frame within the expDir loop.  Then write the stats for all the expDirs into 1 file after the loop.

2014-12-23  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* dead.r: organized cell death statistics in a data frame and print to a file

2014-12-19  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* dead.r: The cumulative cell deaths per zone are printed to a single file.

2014-10-17  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* compare-all.sh: new script that runs compare-body.r, compare-dead.r, and compare-mets.r

	* dead.r: sorted cell death data into Zones 1, 2, and 3, and nearPV and calculated 		cumulative cell deaths per zone.  The results for each Zone is printed to a separate file.

2014-10-15  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* rxn.r: Moved met.r to rxn.r and changed variables to match the
	change from metabolites to reaction products.

2014-10-09  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

2014-07-24  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* dead.r: Append normalized time and cumulative, normalized number
	of dead cells to the output file.

2014-07-09  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	write the montage to that same directory.  Also name it
	$file-eiel.png.

	* ei-plots.r: Write plots to graphics subdirectory.

2014-07-08  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* dead.r: Exit the script if there are no dead to count!

2014-06-30  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* valplot.r: More changes to accommodate non-numeric read.csv
	inputs.

	* islj-dr.r: If one input is longer (e.g. DatModel), then truncate
	it to the shorter series.

2014-06-27  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* valplot.r: Change to Rscript but leave the old setR syntax in
	place to help with debugging.
	Convert dat.final from strings into numbers.

2014-04-04  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* linkprep.sh (SCRIPTS): Add bolus-dose-function.js.

2014-03-24  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* linkprep.sh (SCRIPTS): Change continual-dose-function.js to
	constant-conc-function.js... I don't know if/how to handle this if
	ISLM and ISLJ are merged.

2014-03-17  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (CLASSPATH): Remove jmf.jar.  Swap mason15 with mason17.

2014-01-08  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* valplot.r: Change the "mean" data structure to a matrix so that
	nrow() will work on it, to match the other data structures formed
	through other use cases, e.g. single columns as opposed to a mean
	of several columns.

2014-01-07  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* compare-mets.r: Copy of compare-dead.r, plots column.1 (x-axis)
	against column.2 (y-axis) from the *_metabolite_zone_?_?-?.csv
	files.

	* compare-dead.r: Put graphics in a graphics subdirectory.

	for dat.final for size comparison and resizing experimental data
	when its shorter.

	* compare-dead.r: Add commented out plot command to use log="y".

2013-11-14  aks   <drandrewksmith@gmail.com>

	* isljdr.r: does the same as islj-dr.r but uses Rscript (instead of setR) and 
	argv <- commandArgs(TRUE)
	
	* myei.r: does the same as ei.r but but uses Rscript (instead of setR) and 
	argv <- commandArgs(TRUE)

	* mymet.r: does the same as met.r but uses Rscript (instead of setR) and 
	argv <- commandArgs(TRUE)

	I made these new files instead of modifying the originals so others can still use the 		originals. However, this may no longer be necessary given recent R upgrades.

2013-08-13  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* islj-dr.r: Add tryCatch() clause around matrix summation to
	avoid having to type "q()" every time it fails.

2013-05-22  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* met.r: Change the meat of the script into a function that is
	called for each set of files (metabolite_1_2 vs. metabolite_3) and
	for each zone.

2013-05-20  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* met.r: Calculate average metabolite per cell per time, instead
	of sum.

2013-03-25 gepr <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* farm.sh: Script to spread 1 ISLJ experiment across many machines.
	* valplot-dist.r: Script to average run-[0-9]+.csv output.

2013-01-16  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (delivery.properties, continual-dose-function.js)
	(ei-gradient-function.js): New properties file and new JavaScript
	scripts now need to be logged as parameters.

2012-12-13  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* valplot.r: Add prefix to needed parameters. (e.g. valplot.r x108
	s_at x108/datModel.csv Marker x108_mean_profile_per_node.csv).

2012-11-08  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* islj-dr.r: Turn off the graphics device so the X11 window
	doesn't display.

	* valplot.r: Variant of the single.r script from the Objective-C
	ISL.  It simply plots the specified experimental vs. data series
	and counts the similarity measure.

2012-09-19  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* ei.r: Turn the device off so that the X window isn't invoked.
	This helps run it over a slow network.

2012-09-11  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* ei.r: Cleaned up the code and normalized the EI in each zone by
	dividing the sum by the number of nodes in that zone.

	* ei-plots.r: Script to EI plot data from a CSV file.

	* montage.sh: Simple script to adjoin EI plots.

	with the islj.

	* setR: Setup script required to run R programs as shell scripts.
	Put this in your path, then you can run ./islj-dr.r at the command
	line.

	* islj-dr.r: Added a script to average output fraction data from
	several monte carlo trials.

2012-08-29  glen e. p. ropella  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* run.sh (DIR): Add -Xmx6g to the java command so that we can run
	large experiments.
