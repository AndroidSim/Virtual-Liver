## This script is used to sample a certain number of MC trials across
# a set of experiment directories.
#
# command-line arguments:	1 = number of MC trials in experiment dirs
#							2 = the file containing the set of 
#								experiment directories
##

# Program logic:
# 1) user inputs nMC and file containing exp dirs
# 2) randomly select one exp dir (use dir only once?)
# 3) from that exp dir, randomly select one MC trial, which contains
#    6 files (i.e. body, dead, enzymes, run, hsolute_zone_1_2, and 
#    hsolute_zone_3) (use MC trial # only once?)
# 4) repeat "number of MC trials" times
# 5) put all sampled files into a directory

# check for the right number of arguments
